Email Alias Manager (Free) for Firefox lets you generate and manage email aliases from Haltman Mail Forwarding directly in your browser.

## What this extension does
- Connect with your API key and manage aliases in one place.
- Generate aliases quickly with your preferred domain and copy them instantly.
- Insert aliases directly into email fields while browsing.
- Keep control of where the in-page helper appears.

## Alias generator and manager
- Create aliases from the popup using:
  - a selected domain,
  - readable-word format or random format,
  - optional custom alias name with live preview and validation.
- Browse your aliases in the Choose tab with search, count, copy, and delete actions.
- Use the right-click context menu ("Generate random alias") to create and copy an alias fast.
- Work with domain favorites and a default domain to speed up repeated usage.

## In-page email helper (overlay)
- Adds Generate and Choose actions near email input fields.
- Lets you insert a new or existing alias directly into forms.
- Can be configured globally in Settings:
  - show on all sites,
  - show only on selected sites,
  - hide on selected sites.
- Includes a quick "Disable on this site" action inside the overlay.

## Onboarding and settings

- Disconnect action removes local extension data on this device only (server aliases are not deleted).

## Privacy and security
- Requests are sent only to `https://mail.haltman.io`.

- API key and preferences are stored locally in `browser.storage.local`.
- Optional local lock encrypts the API key with PBKDF2 + AES-256-GCM.
