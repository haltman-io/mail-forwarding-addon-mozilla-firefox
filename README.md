# EMAIL ALIAS MANAGER (FREE)
## Firefox edition – no gods, no masters.

Welcome to the Email Alias Manager.
Yeah, another browser extension.
No, it’s not spyware.
No, it’s not “freemium”.
No, we’re not here to upsell you shit.

You can **view, create, and delete mail aliases** using your own API key.
Generate it yourself at:
👉 https://forward.haltman.io/

No sign-up circus.
No marketing funnels.
No “AI-powered synergy”.
Just aliases. Period.

## WTF is Haltman.io Mail Forwarding?

A **simple, fast, secure, abuse-aware, open-source mail forwarding stack**.

Read that again. Slowly.

- ❌ No *open-core* scam
- ❌ No artificial limits
- ❌ No “starter plan”
- ❌ No VC parasites

What you get instead:

- ✅ Unlimited domains
- ✅ Unlimited users
- ✅ Unlimited addresses
- ✅ Your infra, your rules

Run it. Fork it. Break it. Fix it.
That’s how this shit is supposed to work.

## Why does this even exist?

Because everything else out there **sucks**.

We looked.
Hard.

What we found was a landfill of SaaS trash. “It’s open-source, BUT…”: 
> YoU CaN OnLy hAvE **1 AliaS**
> pAy uS To uNlOcK ThE ReSt
> UpLoAd yOuR StUdEnT Id tO OuR ToTaLlY-NoT-CoMpRoMiSeD InFrA  
> fReE TrIaL If yOu bEg nIcElY AnD GiVe uS YoUr dAtA  
> EnTeRpRiSe pLaN If yOu eNjOy bEiNg rObBeD  

Same old bullshit.
Different landing page.

So we said: **fuck it**.

We built our own, using tools we actually trust and have been abusing for decades:

- Postfix
- MariaDB
- OpenDKIM
- Real servers
- Real configs
- Real control

No more fake “privacy-first” lies.

## Philosophy

This project is our **collective middle finger 🖕**
to anyone who thinks they get to decide:

- how many aliases you’re allowed to have
- what you can run on *your* infrastructure
- how much “freedom” costs per month

You don’t like it?
Good.
Audit the code.
Fix it.
Fork it.
Or go back to your SaaS prison.

Yes, it works.
Yes, it’s boring.
That’s the point.

## FAQ (aka: dumb questions answered once)

**Q: Why isn’t this listed on the AMO (Addons[.]Mozilla[.]Org)?**  
**A:** Because ~~Google~~ Mozilla (joking) moves at the speed of a dying mainframe.

Also:
- The source code is right here.
- Read it.
- Audit it.
- If you don’t trust it, don’t install it.

No mystery blobs.
No obfuscation.
No “trust us bro”.

## Final words

This is not a product.
This is not a startup.
This is not a brand.

It’s a tool.
Use it.

If this README offends you:
👉 mission accomplished 😘

## Greetings to hackerschoice

Massive thanks to **The Hacker's Choice** (THC) for adding and trusting the following domains:

- `smokes.thc.org`
- `segfault.net`

Both are now live and wired into the stack — clean, fast, no bullshit.

Extra respect for running your **own UI** at:  
👉 https://mail.thc.org  

No middlemen.  
No SaaS leashes.  
No corporate clownery.

Just hackers doing hacker things, the way it’s been done since before “cloud” meant someone else’s computer.
